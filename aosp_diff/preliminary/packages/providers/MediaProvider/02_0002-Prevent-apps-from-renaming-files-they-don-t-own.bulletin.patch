Subject: [PATCH] Prevent apps from renaming files they don't own

Malicious apps could rename files in lower file system using
MediaProvider.update even if they don't have access to such files. They
weren't able to update the DB of MediaProvider, but by renaming such
files they could create fake records in MediaProvider DB and then rename
the file to have the same name as their created record, which would
allow them to access these files.

IMAGES_MEDIA_ID, AUDIO_MEDIA_ID and VIDEO_MEDIA_ID URIs were already
guaraded against this vulnerability and the aim of this fix to fix it
for all other Media URIs.

Bug: 304280682
Flag: EXEMPT bug fix
Test: Manual
