Subject: [PATCH] [RESTRICT AUTOMERGE] Allow activity to be reparent while
 allowTaskReparenting is applied
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Any malicious application could hijack tasks by
android:allowTaskReparenting. This vulnerability can perform UI
spoofing or spying on userâ€™s activities.

This CL only allows activities to be reparent while
android:allowTaskReparenting is applied and the affinity of activity
is same with the target task.

Bug: 240663194
Test: atest IntentTests
Change-Id: I73abb9ec05af95bc14f887ae825a9ada9600f771
(cherry picked from commit 7af50c4d5f0354438872167b0e446930caca9deb)
