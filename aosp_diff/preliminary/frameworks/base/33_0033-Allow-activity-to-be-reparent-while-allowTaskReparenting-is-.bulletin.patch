Subject: [PATCH] Allow activity to be reparent while allowTaskReparenting is
 applied
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Any malicious application could hijack tasks by
android:allowTaskReparenting. This vulnerability can perform UI
spoofing or spying on userâ€™s activities.

This CL only allows activities to be reparent while
android:allowTaskReparenting is applied and the affinity of activity
is same with the target task.

Bug: 240663194
Test: atest IntentTests
