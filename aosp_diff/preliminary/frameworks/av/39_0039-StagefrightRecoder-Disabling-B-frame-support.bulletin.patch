Subject: [PATCH] StagefrightRecoder: Disabling B-frame support

Disabling b-frame support from stagefright recorder in case of
audio source as mic and video source is surface use case only
because screen recorder with microphone doesn't play in sync
if b-frame is enabled.
If the audio source selected is INTERNAL (i.e. device) or
MIC_AND_INTERNAL with screen recorder then b frame is supported.

Bug: 288549440
Test: manually check screen recording with audio from mic has audio/video in synch
