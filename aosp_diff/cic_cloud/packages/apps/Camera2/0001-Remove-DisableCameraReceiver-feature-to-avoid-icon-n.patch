Subject: [PATCH] Remove DisableCameraReceiver feature to avoid icon not found
 issue

- Camera2 app has a feature to disable the camera launcher
  activity if there is no Camera detected in the first
  CameraProvider call during the boot, but this is not
  applicable for cic cloud remote camera. Hence disable
  this feature in Camera2 app to avoid camera issues in
  the run time.
- Note: This feature doesn't have dependency on any
  camera use cases.
