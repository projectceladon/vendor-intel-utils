[Celadon Q] aosp & bsp diff patches sorting:

This change works on both aosp_diff and bsp_diff patches.

The main purpose of adding this numbering sort is, trying to manage all the patches by creation time ascending order.

There would be 2 status from current(Oct 2019) utils diff patches.
1.	Like following kernel/lts2018, patch from 01_xxx.patch to 07_xxx.patch were added at the init of utils repo. So, these 7 patches were from 01 to 07;
Then, the 08_0001xxx.patch was later added, and 09_651191xxx.patch was last added.
So, as you can see the numbering from 01_ to 09_ was sorted following creation history.

2.	Like following repo, we can see this repo always managed from 0001 to 0007 since the very beginning by domain team.
So, we keep the management of these .patch files by domain team themselves.
