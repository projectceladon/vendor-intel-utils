Subject: [PATCH 1/3] Solve the EGL configure issue in RenderEngine

After upgrade to HWC2.0, the window surface format is assigned as
PIXEL_FORMAT_RGBA_8888 in DisplayDevice::DisplayDevice, while
RenderEngine::selectEGLConfig doesnt provide Alpha info, the driver
will provide RGBX instead, which will cause CTS failure in
android.display.cts.VirtualDisplayXXX

JIRA: https://01.org/jira/browse/AIA-70
Test: Pass CtsDisplayTestCases and have no regression in other CTS test.
