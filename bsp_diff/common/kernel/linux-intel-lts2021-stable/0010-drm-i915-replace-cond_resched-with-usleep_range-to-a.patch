Subject: [PATCH] drm/i915: replace cond_resched with usleep_range to avoid
 dead lock

Found the deadlock issue most likely caused by thread scheduling, the
problem is like:
1, thread a call i915_active_acquire_barrier function, and will call
take_preallocated_barriers which is used to delete all list nodes with
llist_del_all
2, hw irq is raised up, thread a is scheduled out
3, thread b seems has higher priority and is scheduled in,
i915_gem_do_execbuffer->i915_active_acquire_preallocate_barrier function
is called, there is following code:
while (!llist_empty(&ref->preallocated_barriers))
    cond_resched();
ref->preallocated_barriers is not empty, then will call cond_resched.
While due to CONFIG_PREEMPT is defined, cond_resched is defined as
"return 0;" It means thread b will busy wait and will not relinquish
CPU. From log, we didn't see thread a get chance to be scheduled in.
The result is thread b is busy waiting on ref->preallocated_barriers,
dead-lock happened. At end, when rcu_cpu_stall_timeout is reached, rcu
stall is detected and pop up the kernel error.
Fix this issue by replacing cond_resched with usleep_range, to let
thread b relinquished CPU on its own.
