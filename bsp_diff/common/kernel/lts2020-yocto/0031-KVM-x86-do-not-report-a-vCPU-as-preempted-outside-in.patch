Subject: [PATCH] KVM: x86: do not report a vCPU as preempted outside
 instruction boundaries

commit 6cd88243c7e03845a450795e134b488fc2afb736 upstream.

If a vCPU is outside guest mode and is scheduled out, it might be in the
process of making a memory access.  A problem occurs if another vCPU uses
the PV TLB flush feature during the period when the vCPU is scheduled
out, and a virtual address has already been translated but has not yet
been accessed, because this is equivalent to using a stale TLB entry.

To avoid this, only report a vCPU as preempted if sure that the guest
is at an instruction boundary.  A rescheduling request will be delivered
to the host physical CPU as an external interrupt, so for simplicity
consider any vmexit *not* instruction boundary except for external
interrupts.

It would in principle be okay to report the vCPU as preempted also
if it is sleeping in kvm_vcpu_block(): a TLB flush IPI will incur the
vmentry/vmexit overhead unnecessarily, and optimistic spinning is
also unlikely to succeed.  However, leave it for later because right
now kvm_vcpu_check_block() is doing memory accesses.  Even
though the TLB flush issue only applies to virtual memory address,
it's very much preferrable to be conservative.
