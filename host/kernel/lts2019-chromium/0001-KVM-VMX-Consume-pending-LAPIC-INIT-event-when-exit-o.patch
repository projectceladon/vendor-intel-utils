Subject: [PATCH] KVM: VMX: Consume pending LAPIC INIT event when exit on
 INIT_SIGNAL
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Intel SDM section 25.2 OTHER CAUSES OF VM EXITS specifies the following
on INIT signals: "Such exits do not modify register state or clear pending
events as they would outside of VMX operation."

When commit 4b9852f4f389 ("KVM: x86: Fix INIT signal handling in various CPU states")
was applied, I interepted above Intel SDM statement such that
INIT_SIGNAL exit donâ€™t consume the LAPIC INIT pending event.

However, when Nadav Amit run matching kvm-unit-test on a bare-metal
machine, it turned out my interpetation was wrong. i.e. INIT_SIGNAL
exit does consume the LAPIC INIT pending event.
(See: https://www.spinics.net/lists/kvm/msg196757.html)

Therefore, fix KVM code to behave as observed on bare-metal.
